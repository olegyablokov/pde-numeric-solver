## Getting started
The program is being developed for numerical solving of some pde equations. Right now it supports:
- The 2d heat equation which is solved using the [alternating direction implicit method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_direction_implicit_method#cite_ref-2) (in Cartesian coordinates);
- The 2d center-symmetric wave equation which is solved using the [Crankâ€“Nicolson method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank%E2%80%93Nicolson_method) (in polar coordinates).

The program is tested on Linux Mint 18.2 Cinnamon 64-bit and Windows 10 Education 64-bit.

## Build
The only external library the program depends on is Qt5.
The project is configured with QMake. If you encounter problems with linking please modify the .pro file.

This is an example of how to build the program:
```shell
cd gui_app; mkdir build; cd build                 # Make a build directory.
qmake ../pde_numeric_solver.pro -CONFIG=release   # Generate a Makefile (use -CONFIG=debug for debug configuration).
make                                              # Build the program.
```
If all goes right, an application binary will appear in `debug` or `release` directory (depending on your configuration settings).

## Docs
The project supports auto-documentation by [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). You will need to generate docs to use them:
```shell
cd docs/ 
doxygen Doxyfile
```
`html` and `latex` directories will appear. The default page for html files is `html/index.html`.
