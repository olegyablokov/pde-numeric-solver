BUGS:
	(!IMPORTANT!) wave equation solution is unstable (why?);
	(!IMPORTANT!) memory leak when recalculating the graph data;
	somehow remove the empty place at the top of group boxes (Qt bug, meh);
	Cannot declare a QScriptEngine instance in the PdeSettings class (why?);

FEATURES:
	add explicit calculation of pde (maybe add some graphs for numerical soulution occuracy?);
	add some tooltips (especially for QTable items);
	add a slider for a current graph time regulation;
	add "play"/"stop" buttons for the graph;
