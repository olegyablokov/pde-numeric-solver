BUGS:
	(!IMPORTANT!) wave equation solution is unstable (why?);
	(!IMPORTANT!) memory leak when recalculating the graph data;
	somehow remove the empty place at the top of group boxes (Qt bug, meh);

FEATURES:
	add explicit calculation of pde (maybe add some graphs for numerical soulution occuracy?);
	add some tooltips (especially for QTable items);
	solve graphs in a special thread;
	add a progress bar indicating the solution progress (requires a special thread for the graph solution);
