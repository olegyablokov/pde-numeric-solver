BUGS:
    memory leak	when recalculating the graph data;
	some graphs don't look as they are supposed to;
	(sometimes) little graph shivering. why?..
	pde_settings.json not used (but it should be);

FEATURES:
    add explicit calculation of pde;
	    maybe add some graphs for numerical soulution occuracy?
