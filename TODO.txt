BUGS:
	(!IMPORTANT!) wave equation solution is unstable (why?);
	somehow remove the empty place at the top of group boxes (Qt bug, meh);
	cannot declare a QScriptEngine instance in the PdeSettings class (why?);

FEATURES:
	add the ability to stop a current calculation (the new data must be deleted properly);
	add explicit calculation of pde (maybe add some graphs for numerical soulution occuracy?);
	generating initial conditions is very slow, possibly due to QScriptEngine. make it work faster;
	add a stability checking and approximation display on GUI;
	add different solving methods (like implicit/explicit methods, Crank-Nicolson method etc.);
